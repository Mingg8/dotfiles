# dotfiles

Here are all my favorite dotfiles, taken from my Xubuntu 14.04.

## How do I use your files?
In a terminal, write the following:
1. `git clone https://github.com/rpellerin/dotfiles.git dotfiles`
2. `./dotfiles/scripts/fresh_install_script.sh`
3. Answer no to everything, except to "Do you wish to use the dotfiles from this git repo?"

I also added some other handy scripts in /scripts/.
